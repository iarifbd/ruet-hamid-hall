If you want to see the full code step by step or line by line, you can simply ask for a detailed explanation along with the code. Here's how you might phrase it:

1. **For Full Code with Detailed Explanation:**
   - "Can you provide the full code with a detailed explanation for each step?"
   - "Please explain the code line by line and provide the complete code."

2. **For Step-by-Step Code Generation:**
   - "Can you generate the code step by step, explaining each part as you go?"
   - "I want to understand each part of the code. Can you guide me through the process step by step?"

3. **For Highlighting Specific Sections:**
   - "Can you highlight the important parts of the code and explain why they are necessary?"
   - "Please explain the purpose of each line in the code."

This way, I can provide you with a more thorough breakdown of the code, ensuring that each part is clear and correct.

If you notice that an answer is incomplete due to a server issue or any other reason, you can ask for the completion in the following ways:

1. **Direct Request for Completion:**
   - "It looks like the answer was cut off. Can you please complete it?"
   - "The response seems incomplete. Could you finish explaining the rest of the code?"

2. **Ask for the Missing Parts:**
   - "Can you provide the missing parts of the explanation or code that wasn't included?"
   - "Could you continue from where the previous response left off?"

3. **Request for a Full Summary:**
   - "Can you provide a complete summary or full response based on what was discussed earlier?"
   - "Please give a comprehensive version of the answer, including any missing details."

This will help ensure that you get the complete and detailed information you need.
